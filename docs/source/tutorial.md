# Tutorial
If you are planning to use the Python standalone of DECODE (i.e. this package) going through this document is 10 minutes well worthy.

# Workflow
The repeating pattern of working with this package is
1. Bead Calibration and extraction of spline coefficients (e.g. in SMAP)
2. Set training parameters by a pre-fitting procedure or reasonable guess.
3. Training of the Model
4. Fitting of the experimental data
